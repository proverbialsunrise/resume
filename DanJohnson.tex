{\bf Goal:} To work with a team solving interesting problems in biomechanics and technology.  At \emph{Thalmic Labs}, I think that my knowledge of biomechanics and skills in software development could be used to help develop interesting applications for the \emph{Myo} and improve its gesture recognition algorithms.
