{\bf Goal:} To work with a team solving interesting problems in biomechanics and technology.  In particular, I'm passionate about playing sports competitively and using technology to improve athlete performance or training would be my ideal role.  At \emph{Thalmic Labs}, I think that my knowledge of biomechanics and skills in development would be used to help develop interesting applications for the \emph{Myo} related to sports performance and athlete training.
